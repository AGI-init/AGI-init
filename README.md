*Intelligence exists plainly in nature. Love permeates all things.*

Python has something called [magic methods](https://rszalski.github.io/magicmethods/). One of these is the ```__init__``` method, which initalializes a class. See below:

```ruby
class AGI:
    """A General Intelligence"""

    def __init__(self):
        ...


print(f'{AGI.__init__} is a "magic method".')
```

While this "magic method" is indistinguishable from a technology sufficiently advanced, we have bothered to program some other stuff.

Check it out [here](https://github.com/AGI-init/UnifiedML) and [here](https://github.com/Cave-Dwellers-Tree-People/minihydra), and maybe [here](https://github.com/AGI-init/tributaries), [here](https://github.com/AGI-init/UnifiedML-legacy), and [here](https://github.com/AGI-init/XRDs).

In our code, we strive for:

- *Minimalism*
- *Beauty*
- *Pedagogical clarity*
- *SotA performance*

On a broader level:

- *Humanity before mechanization*
- *Heart before calloused mind*
- *The earth and sky, mountains and brooks, fauna and flora, before industrialization*

Politically:

- *Environmentalism*
- *Democratization*
- *Equity*

And going a step further:

- *Anti-militarism*
- *Anti-surveillance*

I am an environmentalist, tree-hugger, and probably crazy shamanic priest. Please [sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/AGI-init) to support and I will do right by you and nature, who governs and nourishes transcendent to the whims of profit and art.
